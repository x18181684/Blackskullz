# Implementation of Business Processes: Go Car

GoCar is a car renting application-based organization and after the takeover by Europcar, it received an
initial loan of Euro 25 million. It relaunched its service in both Cork and Dublin and the response by the
people to it has been positive. Like the largest cab service provider UBER, GoCar is in loss for the initial
time period. The main source of revenue of GoCar is through customer booking. Over the last 10 years,
it has had a membership of over 40,000 customers but with an increase in business, it is expecting to
triple the ridership in first quarter of 2020.
For creating data, we have used mockeroo and used that in Power BI to generate dashboards and
Dynamic CRM to increase the customer service interaction. We have also used a balanced scorecard to
better explain the strategies to be used to increase the business of GoCar.
